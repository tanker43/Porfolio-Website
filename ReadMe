When starting this project I was considering what (software) I wanted
to use. I wanted this website to work well on any browser or device because
It is showcasing me. I want to be presented as a person that people can
count on.

With that being said I decided I would use Bootstrap 4.
Looking into it I realized that Bootstap 4 websites
are known for being faster as upon the first time a user
acceses a website that uses it. It downloads the appliance
software for it and makes it faster to load for every other
time it is accessed. Bootstrap includes HTML and CSS.
Bootstap also includes a grid system by CSS so it
will make my life easier.

When starting this project I realized that I could take this many
ways. It got very overwhelming because of all the possibilities.
To get rid of this writters block I created a plan of what I wanted
this website to look like roughly. This also included all the features using
a mindmap
